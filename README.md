## Project Description:
Tasked to develop a store app that helps customers purchase products from our business. 
Designed with functionality that would make virtual shopping easier. 
This system utilizes a multitude of technologies that mesh together to take user input and save it to a database.
Customer users can place an order for which product(s) they would like to add to their cart and then confirm it to make an order!
Admin users can also add new store locations and products as well as replenish the amount of available products to the Customers.


## Product Usage:
Have you ever looked into your pet's eyes and wonder if you could ever reciprocate the amount of unconditional love they provide?
Have you ever laid awake wondering why there isn't a specialized service that could make this a thing of the past?
LOOK NO FURTHER, than this easy to use shopping application that allows for customers to purchase any amount of pet treats their pets need.
With a simple-to-use interface, the user is guided through the necessary account creation information with the sign-up feature!
Upon account creation, the user is prompted through a main menu where he or she can view the available products, their cart, order history and if needed store location if they choose to pop in!
As we all know, the pet-loving industry is trying to stay on curve with pet treat development and Purrfect Barkery is no different.
With that said, the Admin can further add products to the potential purchase inventory AND build new locations! As well as maintain a healthy customer relationship with the ability to view their order history and tailor the product to them!
